*** Differences from the prototype version
Several modifications have been made from the prototype version:

- Added WK/WKL top and universal plate.
- Added supports for assembling the top and bottom cases.
- Enlarged the JST channel just a little.

*These changes have not been tested.*
They should probably work fine, but use this work at your own risk.

The prototype version files are included in the =prototype= directory,
so you can use them as well if needed.
